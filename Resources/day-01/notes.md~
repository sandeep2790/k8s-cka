it's a light weight sandbox environment as it not contain whole operating system(only share kernel) but contains all libraries, dependencies 

Docker Flow
Docker File ---> Docker image --push--> Docker Registry --pull--> dev/test/prod environment

Q. why use container rather than virtual machine?
container share infra but work isolated while virtual macine divide infra (resurces are under utilizaton)

kubernetes 

1.container orchestration tool  : It manages container lifecycle, scheduling, and scaling across a cluster of nodes.
2.Self-Healing: Automatically restarts failed containers, replaces and reschedules them, and kills containers that don't respond to user-defined health checks.
3.Automated Scaling: Scales application components up or down based on resource usage or demand.
4.Service Discovery & Load Balancing: Exposes containers using DNS names or IP addresses and balances traffic.
5.kubectl: The command-line tool used to interact with the Kubernetes API to deploy and manage applications.
